# Boids Based Html Game

This is a 2D simulation game implemented using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, featuring flocking behavior based on Craig Reynolds' Boids algorithm. In this game, you play as sharks that are attempting to eat more jellyfish than the other player. Players will use either wasd or the arrow keys to move their shark. There are 5 stages, you begin on the center stage, there is one stage for each direction. You can only navigate to these stages once you have captured all jellyfish on the current stage. Navigate to the desired stage by hitting the border with a character.

## Run Game
